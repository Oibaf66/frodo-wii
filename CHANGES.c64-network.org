		TODO: Add ability to select files to load from disks in
		a menu
c64-network.org, v2:
		* Fix sound when paused
		
		* Fix nunchuk/classic controller joystick controls

		* Auto pause on menu enter

		* Automatically save game info on screenshot timeout 

		* Fix multiple bindings to the same key

		* Fix joystick input on the virtual keyboard

c64-network.org, v1:
		* Sound is transferred in network play now

        * Joystick support is now SDL-based

		* Fix all warnings 

		* Run/Stop handled

		* Redesign the GUI completely 

		* Only one type of network connections now - no need
                  to specify client or master

		* Fix handling of network disconnects (also display a
                  helpful message!)

		* Don't display the network traffic string when connections close

		* Fix handling of packets > 4096 bytes

		* New SDL with GX graphics (although the impact for Frodo is
		quite minimal!)

		* Disable SAM (no need for it on the Wii!)

version 10:
		* Link against Tantrics new SDL build. Improves sound quite a bit.

		* Quit to the homebrew menu unless networking has been enabled ("hard"
		quit fixes a networking issue)

		* Added ability to recurse into directories (partly by Holger Eilts)

		* Large redesign of menu layout and colors (Holger Eilts)

		* Implemented sending text messages over the network to "taunt"
		the other player (obviously a very important feature). Pressing
		F10 enables this.

		* Rearranged menus (networking is more promptly displayed) 

		* Sound transfer for network play has been implemented, but is not
		active

		* Use 32KHz sound samplerate. This improves the cracking sound
		problems from v9 a bit. It also allows sound to be transferred via
		the network	to both Linux/Wii (sharing the same sample rate) and
		lowering the network transfer rate.

version 9:
		* Fix a buffer overflow in the network status string...

		* Add network version field and display an error message if
		an un-matching network version is connected

		* Select with zero timeout when waiting for peer addresses 

		* Don't block the server when connecting and instead draw a status
		string to indicate that we're waiting for a connection

		* Networking support now works (but without sound being transferred). A
		broker is installed on c64-network.game-host.org. 

		* Link with Yohanes port of SDL, modified by Danny Milo to get USB
		keyboards working while still having the Home key do what it
		should

version 8:
		* Lots of networking code which will not work yet 

		* Also add the analog part of the classic controller

		* Make it possible to control the game with the Nunchuk (Aaron Morris) 

		* Correct binding of shifted keys (thanks to Bob Forgan)

		* Fix binding keys without the classic controller (plus etc were missing)

        -- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Wed Mar 11 19:46:11 CET 2009

version 7:
		* Exit with SYS_RETURNTOMENU to make WAD's work

		* Fix bug when multiple buttons are bound to the same keys, we now
		  simply skip one of the bindings.

		* Wiimote direction keys and "fire" can now be bound to keyboard
		  keys

		* Allow binding 1 and other extra buttons to joystick directions
		  and fire

		* Simplify menu code even more

        -- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Mon Feb 23 19:30:09 CET 2009

version 6:
        * Handle reset button (back to menu)

        * General code cleanup, e.g., simplified menu system and reduced the
          amount of code for that and some other things

        * Increase key delay (should hopefully avoid the LOQD problem)

        * Implemented a virtual keyboard which is used to select key bindings and
          also to type in strings

		* Don't load files with zero-size (allows .d64 files where the first file
		  is not a PRG to load correctly). Thanks to Dominik Reichardt for pointing
		  this out

        -- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Sat Jan 24 11:48:01 CET 2009


version 5:
		* Some wiimote sanity checks

		* (Binary only) don't link with Yohanes SDL version anymore. It causes the
		  home button in the menu to quit the emulator. I'll investigate why it happens,
		  not sure right now.

        -- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Fri Jan 16 20:26:12 CET 2009

version 4:
		* (Binary only) link with Yohanes version of SDL (http://wiiapple.googlecode.com).
		  This might bring USB keyboard support, but that's untested.

		* Fixed + and - bindings on the wiimote and a keybinding bug which caused
		  keypresses to go unnoticed.

        * Build the SC version of frodo, which makes some more games work or
          some work better. For example, I *think* that the sound in Exploding
          fist is now correct

		* Added arrow up/down/left/right and some other keys as bindable

        * Some more "auto load" options, and rearranged the top menu order to help
          with this

        * Store preferences together with save games and reload those when the
          saved state is restored again

        * Corrected file extension matching

        * Show current key binding in the menu

		* Added ability to turn on 1541 CPU emulation in the "other options" menu
		  (hint from Vermeylen Schoonakker)

		* Make menu delay a bit shorter (looks better with the classic controller)

		* Merged with the Frodo CVS trunk. This changes a number of things, most
		  visibly the palette

        -- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Fri Jan 16 17:58:51 CET 2009

version 3:
        * Various cleanup of the code

        * Fixed a bug in the menu code which was triggered when there
          is more than one submenu

        * Make speed configurable (basically fast/normal/slow) and
          change the menus a bit

        * Skip SDL_Delay and SDL_GetTicks() which seem to give strange
          results. Use gettime and usleep instead.

        * Improve performance a bit more by doing a custom
          blit-to-double-size implementation

        * Fixed changelog format

        * Bought a Classic controller and fixed so that it actually works...

        * Allow controlling the joystick via the keyboard for the host (basically
          to ease debugging)

        -- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Sun Jan 11 19:46:01 CET 2009

version 2:
        * Also support the .prg and p00, s00 formats. Only .prg has been tested.

        * Added support for classic controllers. NOTE: This is untested since I don't
          have a classic controller!

        * Fixed some corner-cases in the prefs setting to avoid loosing key bindings etc

        * Improve keyboard bindings to handle press and release correctly and also
          both controllers at the same time (key is released when the last controller releases
          it)

        * Handle keycode 0 and therefore make del work

        * Remove the 1-1 graphics option and make stretched the default. Should avoid
          "helpful and constructive" messages such as
             http://wiinewz.com/forums/nintendo-news/91829-frodo-v1-0-a.html#post580580

        * Improved speed just a bit (by enabling compiler optimization!)

        * Only save prefs on exit

        * Pause sound in the menu

        * Handle very long filenames better (thanks Corey89 for pointing this out)

        * Corrected file sorting

        * Better Makefile

        * More keycodes added (C= etc)

        -- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Sat Jan 10 17:26:32 CET 2009

version 1:
        * Initial release
